//C Language: 
=> POP (Procedure Oriented Programming Language)
	
C++ Language:
=> OOP (Object Oriented Programming Language)

Major Concepts:
	
	1. Class and Object
	
	Definition: 
	
	Logical Entity:
	class:Blueprint of an object.
	
	=> data-members and member-fucntions bind together in a single unit 
	that unit is called a CLASS
		
	Physical Entity:	
	object: Everything in a world is considered as an Object
	
	Ex.
	
	Class =>Animal
	
	Objects:
	cow
	cat 
	dog
	
	Access Modifiers:
		
		1. private => by default : Access within a Class
		2. public => Access thought program through Class Object only
		3. protected => Used In Inheritance
	
	
	class class-name
	{
		access modifier:
			
			data-members; // Variables
			member-functions; // Functions
		
	};
	
	int main()
	{
		class-name obj; // Object Creation
		obj.data-members;
		obj.member-functions;
	}
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	2. Encapsulation
	3. Inheritance
	4. Polymorphism
	5. Abstraction
	
	=> Constructor/ Destructor
	=> Friend Class and Friend Function
	=> C++ templates
	=> File Handling
	
	Basic Structure Of C++ Program:
		
		#include<iostream>
		using namespace std;
		int main(){
		
			return 0;
		}
